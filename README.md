# tiktok_video_classification
This project utilizes machine learning models to classify user videos in "claim" or "opinion" type.

### Core Problem Statement
>TikTok users have the ability to report videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. This process generates a large number of user reports that are difficult to address quickly. TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently. This project classifies the user videos in "claim" or "opinion" type using machine learning models to boost the productivity of the company.


> [!TIP]
> Use the python notebook with the raw data "tiktok_dataset.csv". This is self-completing. How ever, more insights and interactive dashboards and stories are available in Tableau Public
